**Project type:** Quantitative Finance â€” Backtesting & Risk Analysis  
**Languages/Libs:** Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib

## Summary
This project collects historical price data for 58 U.S. stocks and the S&P 500 ETF, performs data cleaning, implements multiple portfolio allocation strategies (Equal-Weight, Momentum, Volatility Parity, Kelly Criterion, Minimum-Variance), and backtests them over 2024. For each strategy we produce equity curves, calculate performance metrics (CAGR, volatility, Sharpe), and compare risk metrics (VaR, max drawdown).
